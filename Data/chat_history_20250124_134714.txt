Bot: 1)For an adult or child, place the heel of one hand on the center of the chest at the nipple line. You can also push with one hand on top of the other. For an infant, place two fingers on the breastbone. 2)For an adult or child, press down at least 2 inches. Make sure not to press on ribs. For an infant, press down about 1 and 1/2 inches. Make sure not to press on the end of the breastbone. 3)Do chest compressions only, at the rate of 100-120 per minute or more. Let the chest rise completely between pushes. 4)Check to see if the person has started breathing.
